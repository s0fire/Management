# Overview of Copilot Plugin app template

## Build Copilot Plugin from OpenAI plugin

The plugin allows Copilot to interact directly with third-party data, apps, and services, enhancing its capabilities and broadening its range of capabilities. Plugins allow Copilot to:

- Retrieve real-time information, for example, latest news coverage on a product launch.
- Retrieve knowledge-based information, for example, my teamâ€™s design files in Figma.
- Perform actions on behalf of the user, for example, create a Jira ticket.
